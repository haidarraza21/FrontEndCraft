        <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the visual presentation of web pages by
            applying styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, and layouts. It separates content from design,
            allowing for easier maintenance and responsive web design, where styles adapt to different devices and
            screen sizes. CSS works through a cascading system, where multiple styles can be applied and overridden
            based on their specificity and order.1</p>

    <!--Syntax of CSS-->
    <h1>Syntax of CSS</h1>
    <pre>
        selector {
            property: value;
            property: value;
          }
    </pre>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS syntax consists of selectors and declaration blocks.</li>
        <li>A selector targets the HTML element(s) you want to style, while the declaration block contains one or more
            declarations that define the styles to be applied.</li>
        <li>Each declaration includes a property and a value, separated by a colon and ended with a semicolon. The
            entire declaration block is enclosed in curly braces {}.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

     <!--CSS Selectors-->
     <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
     <p>A selector in CSS is a pattern used to target and apply styles to specific HTML elements. It determines which elements in the HTML document will be affected by the corresponding style rules. There are various types of selectors, such as element selectors (e.g., p for paragraphs), class selectors (e.g., .classname for elements with a specific class), ID selectors (e.g., #idname for a single element with a specific ID), and more complex ones like attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and descendant selectors, allowing for precise and flexible styling across web pages.</p>

     <h2>Types of CSS Selectors</h2>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Universal Selector: </li>
            <li>Element Selector:</li>
            <li>Class Selector:</li>
            <li>Class Selector:</li>
            <li>ID Selector:</li>
            <li>Universal Selector:</li>
            <li>Attribute Selector:</li>
            <li>Descendant Selector:</li>
            <li>Child Selector:</li>
            <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector:</li>
            <li>Pseudo-Class Selector:</li>
            <li>Pseudo-Element Selector:</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Examples of Selectors</h2>
    <p>
        Universal Selector (*): Targets all elements in the document.
    </p>
    <p>Type Selector (Element Selector): Targets all instances of a specific element.</p>
    <div class="class">Class Selector (.classname): Targets elements with a specific class attribute.</div>
    <div class="id">ID Selector (#idname): Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute.</div>
